## Development Process

The program was developed iteratively, starting with a basic text-based output and gradually refining it into a structured, visually clean format. Box-drawing characters and padding were added to improve readability and alignment in the terminal. The final version focuses on clarity, consistency, and ease of execution while meeting the assignment requirements.
